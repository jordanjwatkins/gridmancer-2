###CodeCombat Gridmancer Challenge: 30 Tile Solution

The better of my two solutions to the [CodeCombat](http://codecombat.com/) [Gridmancer](http://blog.codecombat.com/beat-this-level-get-a-programming-job) level.

Approach: Add horizontal lines and combine stacked equal width lines

I created my own version of the level to work with. [Here it is](http://jordanjwatkins.com/gridmancer-2/) after being solved by my algorithm.
